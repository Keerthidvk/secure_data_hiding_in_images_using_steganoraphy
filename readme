I have created an encrypted image by using steganography

the secret code: This is keerthivasan code that we want to hide and the passkey is 123456 for this project


Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

Overview
This project demonstrates image-based steganography, where a secret message is hidden within an image at the pixel level. The message can later be decrypted using a valid passkey.

 Features
- Hide a secret message inside an image.
- Encrypt the message by modifying pixel values.
- Decrypt the message only with the correct passkey.
- Uses OpenCV for image processing.

Project Structure

Secure_Data_Hiding_In_Images_Using_Steganography
│── 📄 secure_data_hiding.py   # Main script
│── 🖼 Image.jpg               # Original image (used for encoding)
│── 🖼 encryptedImage.jpg      # Encrypted image (generated)
│── 📄 README.md               # Documentation
```

 Installation & Setup
 1️⃣ Prerequisites
- Install Python (>=3.7)
- Install OpenCV using pip:
  ```sh
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

 2️⃣ Running the Script
1. Place the image you want to use as a carrier (`Image.jpg`) in the project folder.
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```sh
   python secure_data_hiding.py
   ```
3. Enter the secret message and passkey when prompted.
4. The script will generate `encryptedImage.jpg` with the hidden message.
5. Run the script again and enter the correct passkey to decrypt the message.

How It Works
Encoding:
1. The script loads an image using OpenCV.
2. It converts each character of the secret message into a pixel value.
3. Pixels are modified in a non-sequential pattern to store the data.

Decoding:
1. The user provides the correct passkey.
2. The script reads the pixel values and reconstructs the original message.

Example Usage
Encryption:
```
Secret Code To Unlock: hello123
Enter The Passkey: secret12
The message is now hidden inside encryptedImage.jpg.
```

Decryption:
```
Enter passcode for Decryption: secret12
Decrypted message: hello123
Message successfully retrieved!
```

 ⚠ Limitations
- Works best with "uncompressed image formats" (e.g., `.png`, `.bmp`).
- "JPEG compression" may alter pixel values and affect decryption.
- Message length is "limited by the image size".

🔒 Security Considerations
- The encryption is simple and does not use cryptographic methods.
- For added security, consider using "AES encryption" on the message before embedding it into the image.
